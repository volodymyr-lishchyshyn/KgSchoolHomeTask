function drawChessboard() {

    /*
    Current description in task not enough to 
    understand how a function should work.

    Please describe more in details:
        - purpose
        - initial data
        - conditions
        - restrictions

        Task 2 can be solved like 8 outputs in console logs
        and it is exactly expected result. But I suppose the 
        goal of this task should be different from practice of
        writing console logs

    console.log("wbwbwbwb");

    console.log("wbwbwbwb");
